Theorems about the weak bisimulation of the SPI subsystem and model A, functional correcrness and invariant of model A.


### Files
- `abs0_comb_weak_bisimulationScript.sml`: proofs for the weak bisimulation of the SPI subsystem and model A, based on the weak bisimilarity of SPI and B, A and B, respectively.
- `init/tx_rx/xfer/_correctScript.sml`: the correctness theorems belong to the corresponding sub-automata.
- `abs0_invarScript.sml`: the invariant proofs of model A, which means the model does not enter the error state.
